   <h2>Messsage from Chairman</h2>
   <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been 
    the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of
    type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but
    also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the
    1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently
    with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
